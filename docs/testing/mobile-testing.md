## Responsive Breakpoint Testing

Test these specific viewport widths:

### Critical Breakpoints
- **375px**: iPhone SE (smallest modern phone)

- **1024px**: Desktop (lg:)

### Test Procedure
1. Start at mobile width (375px)
2. Gradually increase width
3. Watch for layout changes at 768px
4. Verify no broken layouts in between

## Reporting Issues

When you find a bug, include:

3. **Steps to Reproduce**: Numbered list
4. **Expected Behavior**: What should happen
5. **Actual Behavior**: What actually happens
6. **Screenshot**: If applicable
7. **Console Errors**: If any

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **Mobile implementation is successful if**:
1. All interactions work on mobile (< 768px)
2. No horizontal scroll (except intended areas)
3. All tap targets are ≥ 44px
4. Text is readable without zooming
5. Forms are easy to use
6. Performance is smooth
7. Desktop experience unchanged
8. No TypeScript or build errors

---

## Quick Visual Test

**30-Second Mobile Check**:
1. Resize browser to 375px width
2. Add a country
3. Enter a salary
4. Add another country
5. Switch tabs
6. Check results

If all of the above works smoothly, mobile implementation is working! ✅
